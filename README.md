# XLOS
this is an operating system made using python and pygame. it has some known bugs, and we are working to fix them. 

PYTHON AND PYGAME IS REQUIRED TO WORK THIS.

This requires pygame and python, just save the file to documents and open via python
On windows do this by :
py documents/XLOS_Pro.py
On mac do this by:
Type in cd documents, then type in python3 XLOS_Pro.py.
You must install pygame and python FIRST.
To do so on mac:
1.You must first download python 3.13.5 which I know works with pygame
2.Then use this command to install pip: python -m ensurepip --upgrade
3.Then you must python3 -m pip --version to ensure it works.
To do so on windows:
1.You must download 3.13.5
2.Then use py -m ensurepip --upgrade to make sure pygame is in installed and this also installs it if it isn't already installed
3.Then use pip -V to ensure installed.
